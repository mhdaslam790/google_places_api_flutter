Here‚Äôs how to use `PlaceSearchField` to display an autocomplete search field, allowing users to select places and retrieve latitude/longitude:

```dart
import 'dart:developer';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_places_api_flutter/google_places_api_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Plugin example app'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PlaceSearchField(
            apiKey: "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY",  // Replace with your actual API key
            isLatLongRequired: true,        // Fetch lat/long with place details
            webCorsProxyUrl: "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com",  // Optional for web
            onPlaceSelected: (placeId, latLng) async {
              log('Place ID: $placeId');
              log('Latitude and Longitude: $latLng');
            },
            decorationBuilder: (context, child) {
              return Material(
                type: MaterialType.card,
                elevation: 4,
                color: Colors.white,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
                child: child,
              );
            },
            itemBuilder: (context, prediction) => ListTile(
              leading: const Icon(Icons.location_on),
              title: Text(
                prediction.description,
                maxLines: 1,
                overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
### üìù Notes

- **`apiKey`**: Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your actual Google API key.
- **`isLatLongRequired`**: Set to `true` to fetch latitude and longitude along with the place details.
- **`webCorsProxyUrl`**: This parameter is optional and used to handle CORS issues for web apps. You can omit it for mobile apps.
- **`UI Customization`**: To see how to modify the UI components of the autocomplete field, refer to the [flutter_typeahead](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_typeahead) package. This package offers extensive customization options for the typeahead widget used in the `PlaceSearchField`.
